# Theory of Operation

A very simple musical instrument.

Musical desktop with things that make a sounds aligned in a grid.

Things that make a sound, are like broadcast stations that emit a customizable beep every X beats.

A beat is a beat, standard musical BPM.

The grid is a simple object storage device, it is the same kind of grid mode that you can put a standard Desktop with Icons into. It is just a way of keeping things tidy.
